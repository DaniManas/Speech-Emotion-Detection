Speech Emotion Recognition
==========================

## Basic Idea :
This machine learning model tries to detect and predict various emotions in speech signals or human audio by detecting different features and components of speech affected by human emotion. Emotion detection from speech is a relatively new field of research. Here, we are trying a new approach or ways to contribute to emotion recognition research.


## How to run file :
To implement this project on your Machine
1. Clone this repository.
2. Go to the terminal and type `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Then open ./Code/main_speech_emotion_recognition.ipynb and run it.

## Bugs :

## Limitation and Further growth : 
1. Need to record audio in a clear and silent environment.
2. The dataset is not accurate and prominent. Even, the human ear can't detect accurate emotion in some audio. **Need Promising dataset.**
